## Data Cleaning and Exploration in SQL 
This SQL script embarks on a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 data, employing advanced SQL techniques to glean insights into infection rates, mortality trends, and vaccination progress across various global locations and continents. The initial steps involve meticulous data filtering to ensure only relevant and complete datasets are considered, setting a foundation for robust analysis. By calculating death percentages and infection rates relative to population size, the script provides a nuanced understanding of the pandemic's impact on different regions. Through the strategic use of joins and window functions, it meticulously tracks the cumulative number of vaccinations and computes the percentage of the population vaccinated over time, revealing the trajectory of vaccination efforts. The inclusion of common table expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables facilitates complex calculations, enhancing the clarity and depth of the analysis. Ultimately, by creating a view to store processed data, the script sets the stage for ongoing visualizations and deeper explorations, ensuring that insights derived from this data exploration are not only comprehensive but also actionable for public health strategies and policy decisions.

## Data Transformation in SQL

This project focuses on cleaning the Nashville Housing dataset using SQL by performing several key tasks to ensure data uniformity and accuracy. First, the SaleDate column is standardized to a consistent date format. Missing PropertyAddress values are populated using SQL joins based on matching ParcelID. The PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress fields are split into separate columns for address, city, and state to facilitate easier analysis. The SoldAsVacant field is updated to replace 'Y' and 'N' with 'Yes' and 'No'. Finally, duplicate rows are identified and removed, and unused columns are dropped, resulting in a clean and standardized dataset ready for further analysis.
