## Data Cleaning and Exploration in SQL 

This SQL script embarks on a comprehensive exploration of COVID-19 data, employing advanced SQL techniques to glean insights into infection rates, mortality trends, and vaccination progress across various global locations and continents. The initial steps involve meticulous data filtering to ensure only relevant and complete datasets are considered, setting a foundation for robust analysis. By calculating death percentages and infection rates relative to population size, the script provides a nuanced understanding of the pandemic's impact on different regions. Through the strategic use of joins and window functions, it meticulously tracks the cumulative number of vaccinations and computes the percentage of the population vaccinated over time, revealing the trajectory of vaccination efforts. The inclusion of common table expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables facilitates complex calculations, enhancing the clarity and depth of the analysis. Ultimately, by creating a view to store processed data, the script sets the stage for ongoing visualizations and deeper explorations, ensuring that insights derived from this data exploration are not only comprehensive but also actionable for public health strategies and policy decisions.

## Data Visualization in Tableau

This project aims to create insightful visualizations using Tableau to analyze and present COVID-19 data, focusing on deaths and spread across various geographical locations. The dataset includes information such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and population statistics for different countries and regions. Initial steps involve data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data accuracy. Visualizations will include interactive maps, line charts, and bar graphs to depict trends in COVID-19 spread and mortality rates over time. Comparative analyses will highlight disparities in infection rates and mortality across continents, countries, and cities. Advanced features of Tableau, such as filters, tooltips, and dashboards, will be utilized to enhance interactivity and user engagement. The project aims to provide actionable insights into the pandemicâ€™s impact on different regions and demographics, aiding in informed decision-making for healthcare and policy interventions.

## Data Transformation in SQL

This project focuses on cleaning the Nashville Housing dataset using SQL by performing several key tasks to ensure data uniformity and accuracy. First, the SaleDate column is standardized to a consistent date format. Missing PropertyAddress values are populated using SQL joins based on matching ParcelID. The PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress fields are split into separate columns for address, city, and state to facilitate easier analysis. The SoldAsVacant field is updated to replace 'Y' and 'N' with 'Yes' and 'No'. Finally, duplicate rows are identified and removed, and unused columns are dropped, resulting in a clean and standardized dataset ready for further analysis.

## Correlation in Python

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing movie information, focusing on exploring relationships and trends among various attributes. The dataset includes details such as movie names, ratings, genres, release years, scores, votes, directors, writers, stars, countries, budgets, gross earnings, production companies, and runtimes. Initial steps involve data cleaning to handle missing values and ensure data integrity. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, including statistical summaries and visualizations, will be employed to understand distributions, correlations, and patterns within the dataset. Specific analyses will explore factors influencing gross earnings, such as genre, director, writer, and production budget. The project will conclude with insights derived from the analysis, highlighting key factors impacting movie success based on the dataset's findings.
